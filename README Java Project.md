# Java-Final-Project (CS206)
From the Assignment itself:
Create an interfact that will allow a user whom is a vehicle salesman to enter and display the costs fo the vehicles based on type that he has sold this year. This is a group project. There are at four classes, and each class needs a different method for storing data. The four classes are:
1. Cars
2. Motorcycles
3. Boats
4. Planes
Each method to be used with each class:

A. For all cars sold, use a Stack to deal with these. You should be able to place a new item in the stack and remove an item and display all the items in the stack. The car object should hold the following attributes:
  1. Name
  2. Make
  3. List Price
  4. Sold Price
  5. Commission Made
  6. Color
  7. Status (new, used, etc.)
  8. Mileage
  9. Year
  10. Extras
  
B. For all Motorcycles, use a Queue. Be able to insert, delete, and display all the items. Use the same attributes for each object as the car object(s).

C. For Boats, use just an array. This array should have the same abilities as the other two to insert, delete, and display all the items. However, insertion must be done via insertion sort. The following attributes are required (but not limited to):
  1. List Price
  2. Sale Price
  3. Commission
  4. Make
  5. Year
  
D. For planes, use a linked list. The link list should have the ability to insert, delete, and display the list. Attributes should be the same as the Boats.

E. Additional Requirements
  1. There must be one recursive working method somewhere in the program.
  2. Each method should be able to hold at least 10 items.
  3. There should be checks to correctly deal with full arrays, stacks, or queues. They should allow the user to make room rather than just blanking the user out.
  4. The only way to exit the program is by the user selection of ending the program. No Close button in the top corner.
  
F. For this project, the group also decided to make this program with a GUI, though this was not covered in any of the classes so far. This was to avoid a messy text-based interface.

G. Names of people who worked on this project should be in the about section of the program, but are also listed here.
