# Data-Structures-Final-Project-Specifications
The following software was used and is recommended to run this program:
1. Bluejay V 3.0.7 or later
2. https://bluej.org/

Recommendations for improvement:
1. There are several bugs that still need fixing, including a linked list display issue.
2. The ability to export all current data to text files so records can reload upon starting the program again.
3. The ability to add an image of the object being added.

Most significant learning curve:

Creating the interface was byfar the most significant learning experience. As this was not required by the project nor was it ever covered in the class itself, the process for creating the GUI was all out of class time. While no other groups in the class went so far as to create as clean of an interface, this additional perk of the program helped to better understand the use of the code, as well as see how sorting and insertion worked visually.
